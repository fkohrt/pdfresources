TODO

\hyper@anchor, \__hyp_destination:n:
check use of \@pdfviewparams for dvips ...


\__hyp_pstringdef:Nn: reconsider naming
check the conversion through the drivers!

replace \hyper@chars

do we need a \pdf_catalog_gremove:n? 
  baseurl? 
  pdfpagelayout? 
  are there other cases?
the catalog is not a simple data structure, so removing something would need
quite a bunch of functions ...
